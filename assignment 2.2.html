<p>The origins of cancer are multifactorial, with both genetic and environmental elements playing pivotal roles. Genetic mutations, either inherited or acquired over time, can predispose individuals to certain cancers. Environmental factors, such as exposure to carcinogens like tobacco smoke, pollutants, and radiation, contribute significantly. Lifestyle choices, including poor diet, lack of physical activity, and excessive alcohol consumption, further increase cancer risks.</p>
