<h2>Types of Cancer:</h2>

<p>
    Cancer manifests in various forms, each with distinct characteristics and treatment approaches
    <ol>
        <li><h4>Carcinomas:</h4>These cancers originate in epithelial cells, covering external and internal body surfaces. Adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas are common subtypes, often found in organs like the lungs, breast, and skin.</li>
        <li><h4>Sarcomas:</h4>Developing in connective tissues like bones and muscles, sarcomas are less common but can be aggressive. Osteosarcoma, arising in bone tissue, is an example of a sarcoma.</li>
        <li><h4>Lymphomas:</h4>Affecting the lymphatic system, lymphomas can be Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin. They involve the abnormal growth of cells in lymph nodes, spleen, and other immune system components.</li>
        <li><h4>Leukemias:</h4> These cancers impact blood and bone marrow, leading to an overproduction of abnormal blood cells. Acute and chronic forms exist, depending on the speed of progression and cell type involved.</li>
        <li><h4>Central nervous system cancers</h4>Tumors in the brain and spinal cord can be primary or result from the spread of cancer from other parts of the body.</li>
